The pfiles in this directory contain modifications made in 2016 of open-source code downloaded from:
https://www.stat.washington.edu/~ebfox/software/HDPHMM_HDPSLDS_toolbox.zip.

As required by the derivative work license, the original license is retained and the changes
are noted below:

* added functionality to map continuous time SDE parameter priors to discrete state space models enableing exact likelihoods for Kalman Filter (no approximations)

* updated corresponding inverse wishart function calls

* updated label assignment scripts to save and plot trajectory segmentation results based on new MCMC output

* added new driver to account for single particle tracking models driven by standard diffusion (classic free, confined, and directed diffusion)

* added new option to runstuff.m in source code in "runstuffUrsaBatch.p".  this allows for "inverse Wishart on (A,Sigma) and normal on mu ('MNIW-N'), matrix normal" option for  AR(1) KF model (with random level offset) using continuous time SDE parameters driving priiors discussed in Refs. below.

* added python batch run routine call MATLAB routines (tested on R2015b)  with wrapper script "multiJobSubmitJLS.py".  this code depends on MATLAB and lightspeed addon toolbox.  data in paper was produced with lightspeed compiled for OS X 10.12 with MATLAB  R2015b.
